[Live app URL link ](https://similar-movies.herokuapp.com)

Recommenders are systems, which predict ratings of users for items. There are several approaches to build such systems and one of them is Collaborative Filtering. 
This notebook and app, shows a recommendation system where the user selects a movie from the list of top 5000 movies and it gives you the top 5 most similar movies along with their images.

This notebook is also deployed in Heroko , so you can use the app using this URL : https://similar-movies.herokuapp.com
